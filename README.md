# Data Analysis Report: GroMo Partner App Reviews

**1. Objectives**

The primary objectives of this data analysis were to understand user feedback and trends for the GroMo Partner app based on Google Play Store reviews. Specific goals included:

- Analyzing the distribution of star ratings.
- Tracking the volume of reviews and average rating over time to identify trends.
- Identifying common themes, words, and phrases in both positive and negative reviews.
- Performing sentiment analysis on review messages.
- Assessing the level of developer engagement through replies to reviews.
- Exploring potential areas of improvement or aspects that users appreciate.

**2. Methodology**

The analysis was conducted using Python with libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, and `nltk` and `textblob`/`vader_lexicon` for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

The steps involved were:

- Loading review data from a CSV file (`gromo_play_store_reviews_detailed.csv`).
- Preprocessing the data, including converting review dates to datetime objects and handling potential data anomalies like future dates.
- Analyzing and visualizing the distribution of star ratings.
- Performing time-series analysis by resampling data monthly to plot review volume and average rating trends.
- Applying text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization) to review messages.
- Identifying and visualizing the most frequent unigrams and bigrams in negative (1-2 stars) and positive (4-5 stars) reviews.
- Generating a word cloud to visualize prominent terms in negative reviews.
- Conducting sentiment analysis using the VADER lexicon to assign compound sentiment scores and categorize reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The correlation between star ratings and VADER sentiment scores was also visualized.
- Assessing developer engagement by calculating and plotting the percentage of reviews with developer replies, both overall and segmented by star rating.
- An illustrative example of tracking the monthly trend of reviews mentioning specific keywords (e.g., 'payment', 'support', 'crash') was included to demonstrate how potential areas of improvement or positive feedback could be monitored over time.

**6. Further Analysis Required**

To create a more robust analysis report, the following further analyses are recommended:

- **Topic Modeling (e.g., LDA):** Implement a more sophisticated topic modeling technique to identify underlying themes across all reviews, not just frequent words. This can reveal broader categories of feedback (e.g., "Onboarding Issues," "Payment Process," "App Stability") that might not be obvious from n-gram analysis alone.
- **Sentiment Analysis by Topic:** Once topics are identified, analyze the sentiment within each topic. This helps pinpoint which specific areas or features of the app are generating the most positive or negative sentiment.
- **Correlation with App Updates:** If possible, obtain data on app update release dates. Correlate changes in review volume, average rating, sentiment, and topic prevalence with specific updates to understand their impact on user feedback.
- **User Segmentation:** If user data is available (while respecting privacy), segment reviews by user characteristics (e.g., new vs. returning users, location if applicable) to see if different user groups have distinct feedback patterns.
- **Benchmarking:** Compare the GroMo Partner app's ratings, sentiment, and developer engagement metrics against competitors (if data is available) to understand its relative performance in the market.
- **Qualitative Deep Dive:** While quantitative analysis provides trends, a qualitative review of a sample of reviews, especially those with detailed feedback or lower ratings, can provide rich context and specific examples of user experiences.
- **Advanced Keyword/Phrase Tracking:** Refine keyword tracking to include variations and related terms more effectively. Analyze the context in which keywords are used to understand the nature of the feedback (e.g., "payment received" vs. "payment pending").
- **Analyze Developer Reply Content:** If developer reply content is available, analyze the themes and sentiment of the replies to assess the quality and helpfulness of the support provided.
